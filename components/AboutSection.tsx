        <p>
          We looked for ways to truly go offline, but most &quot;solutions&quot; still lived on screens. A screen asking you to avoid screens never felt right, so we asked a different question.
        </p>

        <p>
          What if something as engaging as a Netflix series could exist offline? Not something you watch, but something you experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading long books has become difficult for many of us. Not because we don&apos;t love stories, but because our attention now comes in short bursts. So we didn&apos;t write a book.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, we broke stories into pieces. Letters, clues, and fragments that arrive slowly over time. No screens. Just paper in your hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          You think, connect dots, and discover along with others doing the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Waiting Club is our answer to a simple idea. Waiting doesn&apos;t have to be empty. It can be the experience.
